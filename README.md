# YARA Rules Creation & Testing
This is a collection of YARA rules I have written alongside a Python Script to be able to direct a scan using the rule to a specific Directory or File. I had a lot of help in understanding and writing these rules from Pack Of Coders on Udemy. 

## Objective

The objective of the first half of this Lab was to understand how to write YARA rules and learn what to look for to Identify Malware or other malicious processes that may warrant further investigation. The Second half of this lab revolved around building a python script to be able to run a specific YARA rule against a file or directory. This is one of the most interesting labs I have done, and I look forward to continuing to update my rules, so check back often for updates.   

### Skills Learned

- Developed proficiency in writing YARA rules for malware detection
- Hands on Experience looking for Indicators of Compromise (IOC)
- Improved Troubleshooting Skills in Both YARA and Python
- Gained Knowledge in Threat Detection and Analysis Using YARA

### Tools Used

- YARA : For Creation Of Rules
- Python : To Automate Scanning using YARA Rules
- Visual Studio Code : Writing and Debugging YARA Rules and Python Script
- Windows Command Prompt : For Executing Scans
